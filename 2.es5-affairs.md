Last weekend I watched a video about Java8 and Nashorn. This is a much faster successor to Rhino by Oracle. They claimed to have passing all of more than 11000 tests of es5 spec, even though no browser vendor made compatibility to so scrupulous degree. The presentation was from late 2012, hence I decided to check, how things are going for now.
You can run them by yourself [here](http://test262.ecmascript.org/), but I already did that for most popular browsers and even not popular ones. And moreover, I found that tests often fail not because of the feature in description is implemented incorrectly. Simpler, some tests are not independent. Extrapolating that to all tests would be an [survival bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias). Hence I'm not saying all tests are badly written. But if one wants to interpret the fact of test fail, reading description is not enough. On the bad note, though, a pair of tests are out of tune with specification. They expect some certain behavior, when it is clearly stated that it may be implementation-dependent.  
Here's a [hg repo viewer](http://hg.ecmascript.org/tests/test262/file/d067d2f0ca30/test/suite/), where separate tests could be found. 

## TL;DR

If you don't want to go deep into details about different tests and my rants about their quality, here's a list what you'd better not to do from es5:

- test your code in different browsers, even if you're using bulletproof library like jQuery - these tests themselves couldn't be run in IE8 due to bug in UI
- in Firefox one cannot change numerical properties on `window`
- in Firefox `[[Writable]]`, `[[Configurable]]` and `[[Enumerable]]` are incorrectly set to `false` when not provided in **re**-defining properties on `window` - just pass them for every `defineProperty` call.
- do not rely on features of strict mode. For example, sometimes primitives used as `this` are still wrapped into objects - in special cases or in browsers (IE9) which, do not support strict mode at all. I personally faced a bug emerged from combination of `jQuery.each` on array of primitives and using strict equality for `this`.  
  Using strict mode as a helper for early problem detection is encouraged, though.
- do not rely exclusively on feature presence - some implementations are rather buggy - e.g. `defineProperty` in Safari 5
- IE before 11th use slightly different representation for `Date.toString`, hence do not rely on exact values.
- some old browsers still parse strings as octal numbers, starting from zero - use `parseInt(n, 10)` or `Number(n)` if you're sure there're no trailing characters.
- `String.prototype.localeCompare` returns incorrect results for non-canonical Unicode representations in many browsers
- do no not rely on assumption that code will fail at some certain point with some certain error. This is mostly OK for tests, though.
- hardly one would use that in real code, but messing with numeric properties on `Array.prototype` is not only difficult to understand, but is also vulnerable to subtle differences in implementations

## Detailed analysis of failed tests

Listing full test names could be too "noisy" for visual perception, hence I compacted several names with syntax similar to [imports in es6](http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:modules#quick_examples). E.g.: "1.1.2, 1.1.3" is written as "1.1.{2,3}".

First of all I need to mention, that six `Date` tests do not fail if and only if you live California or elsewhere near. Relax, it is neither discrimination, nor location tracking - just OS setting, timezone should be UTC-8.

15.5.4.9_CE  
> Tests that `String.prototype.localeCompare` returns 0 when comparing Strings that are considered canonically equivalent by the Unicode standard

All browsers except Chrome and [Firefox 29 beta](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=853301#c101) fails that test.  
Interesting enough, strings from test case ("\\u1111\\u1171\\u11B6" vs "\\ud4db") are even displayed differently in FF29- (and strangely Chrome33-34): the first string looks like [linear Hangul](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangul#Linear_hangul), whilst the second one is normal Jamo:  
<span style="font-size:200%">&#x1111;&#x1171;&#x11B6;</span> vs <span style="font-size:200%">&#xd4db;</span>

OK, mainstream browsers go first in some arbitrary order. 


### Chrome 32+

11.2.3-3_3
> Call arguments are not evaluated before the check is made to see if the object is actually callable (undefined member)

I.e. in expression `({}).b(f());` engine should call `f()` before `.b` is evaluated and detected as non-callable, whilst for `({}).a.b(f());` browser should not call `f()`. In the second case Chrome incorrectly calls `f()` as well.

S15.8.2.8_A6  
> Checking if Math.exp is approximately equals to its mathematical values on the set of 64 argument values; all the sample values is calculated with LibC

Chrome35 have similar bugs in 3 more tests.

The relative error is 2<sup>-50</sup>, while precision of [IEEE754 doubles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format) used in javascript, is 52 bits. So this error hardly matters, unless you're doing a REAL SCIENCE.
Moreover, specification [15.8.2] doesn't impose any certain requirements on computation accuracy for math functions:

> The behaviour of the functions `acos`, `asin`, `atan`, `atan2`, `cos`, `exp`, `log`, `pow`, `sin`, `sqrt`, and `tan` is not precisely specified here except to require specific results for certain argument values that represent boundary cases of interest. For other argument values, these functions are intended to compute approximations to the results of familiar mathematical functions, but some latitude is allowed in the choice of approximation algorithms.

Test itself is rather arguable. Are those approximations enough or not? Even if this is a problem, it's not a big one.

### Safari 7 (MacOS/iOS)

10.2.1.1.3-4-{16,18}-s  
`TypeError` should be thrown when changing `global.NaN` or `global.undefined` in strict mode.


### Safari 6 (iOS)

Surprisingly it doesn't fail the previous test.

S10.4.2_A1.{1,2}_T{1-11}  
`eval` within global execution context - scopes are not chained properly

15.5.4.9_3  
> Tests that `String.prototype.localeCompare` treats a missing "that" argument, undefined, and "undefined" as equivalent.

`str.localeCompare()`, `str.localeCompare(undefined)` and `str.localeCompare("undefined")` should be the same for any possible value of `str`.


### Firefox 27-33

10.4.3-1-{104,106}  
> Strict mode should not ToObject thisArg if not an object.  

In es3 and non-strict es5, primitive passed as `this`, are wrapped into object (String, Number or Boolean). In strict mode primitives should not be unwrapped. This works in general wherever strict mode is enabled and supported.  
In getter, defined on `Object.prototype` and used on primitive value (via [boxing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_(computer_science)#Boxing)), `this` still should be a primitive. And this is where Firefox fails.

Actually, if you write cross-browser code, you shouldn't rely on aforementioned feature of strict mode.

**15.11.4.4-8-2**  
> `Error.prototype.toString` return empty string when 'name' is empty string and 'msg' is undefined

FF returns "Error" if name is empty. Not a serious bug, again.

**Numerous bugs with `Object.defineProperty`.**

Sometimes (6 from 15.2.3.6-4-{292-296}) checks interfere with implementation details of mapping between `arguments` object and actual named arguments like this:
<pre><code class="language-javascript">(function (a) {
    Object.defineProperty(arguments, '0', { value: 2 });
    return a;
}(1));</code></pre>
BTW in strict mode all browsers demonstrate the same behavior as Firefox.

-354-4, -354-13, -360-3, -360-7, -531-4, -531-13, -538-3, -538-7 and 15.2.3.7-6-a-24  
In these cases there's really an error. All 3 properties: `writable`, `enumerable` and `configurable` become `false` on re-definition if they're not provided. This is detected on `window` only and doesn't happen for normal objects. -531-17 and -538-7 fails even earlier due to inability to redefine numerical properties on window.

**15.4.4.{14-22}**  
Problems with `Array.prototype` methods applied to global object.  
The same reason as just mentioned - it fails because one cannot declare numerical keys on `window` - they continue to be `undefined`.

Actually, every method of `Array.prototype` has a NOTE like:

> The `reduce` function is intentionally generic; it does not require that its **this** value be an Array object. Therefore it can be transferred to other kinds of objects for use as a method. Whether the `reduce` function can be applied successfully to a host object is implementation-dependent.

I.e. spec doesn't require ability to successfully apply those methods to host objects! So tests are just incorrect.


**S15.4.4.4_A3_T1**  
> [[Prototype]] of Array instance is Array.prototype, [[Prototype] of Array.prototype is Object.prototype  

This test fails due to implementation details of `concat` (not own property remains not own in Firefox).

**15.4.4.4-5-c-i-1**  
> Array.prototype.concat will concat an Array when index property (read-only) exists in Array.prototype (Step 5.c.i)

It fails because `Array.prototype.concat.call(1)[0]` results in `number` primitive, and not `Number` object. The check of copy's properties existence actually passes.


### IE11

The latest 11th version fails only one test about `localeCompare`


### IE10

IE11 in IE10 emulation mode shows the same behavior.

It fails one more test, which is rather funny:  
**S15.5.4.7_A1_T11**  
Fails for eastern hemisphere (UTC**+**N timezones), cause IE does not display leading zeroes for dates: `new Date(0).toString()` &rarr; "Thu Jan **1** 04:00:00 UTC+0400 1970"  
Yeah, it sounds so arcane, but check in code is really like that:  
`(date.indexOf(date.getTimezoneOffset()>0 ? '31' : '01')) === 8`  
One way or another, it reveals a piece of non-standard behavior of IE.

### IE9

IE9 fails significantly more tests additionally to aforementioned two.
And true IE9 shows results somewhat different from higher versions in corresponding emulation mode (surprise-surprise). The only good point about that is that both emulation modes (IE11@9 and IE10@9) works the same.  
Of course, it also can't pass 500+ tests about strict mode. I didn't even check 'em all - just filtered out.

**8.12.9-9-c-i_{1,2}** (passes in emulation mode)  
> Redefine a configurable accessor property to be a data property on a non-extensible object

with `preventExtensions`.

**10.6-13-a-2** (passes in emulation mode)  
> A direct call to arguments.callee.caller should work

<pre><code class="language-javascript">(function (called) {
    function test1(flag) { if (!flag) test2(); else called = true; }
    function test2() { arguments.callee.caller(true); }
    test1();
    return called;   
}(false));</code></pre>

Rather tricky and strange.

**11.2.3-3_{1-2,5-8}**  
> Call arguments are evaluated before the check is made to see if the object is actually callable.

It fails differently than in Chrome.

**15.11.4.{2,3}-1**  
> Error.prototype.{name,message} are not enumerable

**15.2.4.4-{1,2}**  
> Using `Object.prototype.valueOf` for non-object values

Expected result: primitive value should be wrapped into corresponding object.
Workaround: if you need to wrap primitive into object, `Object(value)` seems to be working properly everywhere.

**S15.2.4.4_A{12-15}**  
`Object.prototype.valueOf` invoked with `null`/`undefined` should throw an error.

**15.4.4.4-5-c-i-1**  
> Array.prototype.concat will concat an Array when index property (read-only) exists in Array.prototype (Step 5.c.i)

The same as in Firefox.

**15.5.4.11-1** (passes in emulation mode)  
> 'this' object used by the `replaceValue` function of a `String.prototype.replace` invocation

**S15.5.4.14_A1_T{6-9}**, ...**A2_T7**  
Split should not coerce its argument to string "undefined" if its argument is `undefined`.

**15.9.5.40_1**  
> Date.prototype.setFullYear - Date.prototype is itself an instance of Date

Test just calls `Date.prototype.setFullYear(2012);` and expects `2012` to be read back. Hardly you'll need that in practice, but this test fails only in IE9. All other higher and lower versions aren't affected.


## Old non-IEs

They are not widespread at all for now, hence only short overviews for each. Nonetheless, number of such client will not drop abruptly in foresee future - because of vendor-lock or similar situation.


### Safari 5 (Win)
  
- even though, it claims support of defining properties, it fails on hundreds of tests regarding them.
- and on dozens regarding strict mode
- `parseInt` still accepts octal.
- `JSON.parse('{"__proto__":[]}');` returns object with 2 `__proto__` properties!


### Opera 12

Surprisingly good, only 4 bugs.

- `parseInt` still accepts octal.
- Does not treat whitespace characters from `[\\u2000-\\u23ff]` as those in regular expressions. (2 tests).
- `String.prototype.localeCompare` does not treat missing 'that' argument as undefined.



### Android 4.3 (Galaxy S3)

- `parseInt` still accepts octal.
- `String.prototype.localeCompare` does not treat missing 'that' argument as undefined.
- Failed to add a property to an object when the object's prototype has a property with the same name and [[Writable]] set to false. Non-writable property on a prototype written to.
- Call arguments are not evaluated before the check is made

### Android 4.1 (ASUS fonepad)

- `JSON.parse('{"__proto__":[]}');` returns object with 2 `__proto__` properties!
- `String.prototype.localeCompare` does not treat missing 'that' argument as undefined.
- do not mess with `function.length` for fn instances.
- numerous bugs with `Array.prototype` methods applied to the global object (`window`)


## IE8

After few hours of night hacking I made test suite running in IE8 - there're several things, which break in the GUI and test runner itself.

Of course, there're no es5 features, but they could be polyfilled to some extent. Nonetheless, some bugs due to subtle discrepancies in syntax parsing can arise.

Bugs are limitless, but I'll try to summarize them in concise way. Keep in mind, that most bugs from IE9 are also reproduced, but they're too minor comparing to the HELL happening below.

Incompatibilities described in terms how IE8 behaves. Correct behavior is either stated explicitly or considered obvious.

### Scope

- indirect `eval` call does not set scope to the global context
- variable name spoiling:
  * function declared within `if` block
  * named function expressions spoil the outside scope.
  * multiple names for function
  * name used in `catch` block 
- `TypeError` is used instead of `ReferenceError` for referencing variable
- `delete` behave differently in unusual positions. Like `delete foo();`
- global properties couldn't be removed with `delete` operator, [workaround](http://stackoverflow.com/a/1824228/255363)
- it's only possible to define `length` variable with `var` keyword in a global scope. Otherwise you'll get an error, trying to set it.
- it's possible to delete `prototype` property.

### Syntax

- trailing comma adds extra empty element to array and fail with SyntaxError in object literals
- most reserved words can't be used for [dot-notation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Property_Accessors), in object literals and function names. More or less real use cases for them are:  
  * `jQuery("<div>", { class: "someClass" })`
  * `jQuery(someSelector).css({ float: "left" })`  
The first one fails in IE, while the second one doesn't, because it isn't a reserved word in IE8. For the same reason IE8 allows other names such as `let`, `interface` and so on.  
And both pieces of code fails in [deprecated YUI compressor](http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2012/10/16/state-of-yui-compressor/).
- the following constructions should generate syntax error:
  * `if (...) { ... }; else`
  * `do {}; while(..)`
  * `try {...}; finally{...}`
- `\\\\v` VERTICAL TAB, `U+2028` LINE SEPARATOR and `U+2029` PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR can mess your code everywhere: in code itself, RegExp literals, comments.

### Regex

- many whitespace characters are not considered as `\\s`. E.g. &amp;nbsp; `U+00A0` or separators from previous point.
- Symbol "İ" `U+0130` is considered as `\\w` (ru-RU locale)
- backreference used before actual capturing-group incorrectly considered as charcode escape.  
  `/\\1(A)(B)\\2/.exec("\\1ABB");` vs `/\\1(A)(B)\\2/.exec("ABB");`
- `/[^]/` should match anything and `/[]/` should match nothing, `RegExpError` is thrown instead
- `RegExpError` is thrown instead of `SyntaxError` for wrong syntax
- `RegExpError` is thrown instead of `TypeError` for wrong flags
- flag duplications is allowed in both literals (`/./ii`) and dynamic construction via `RegExp`
- non-matched capturing groups become `""` instead of `undefined`
- non-matched capturing groups inside repetition do not overwrite matched ones from previous matches  
<pre>/(z)((a+)?(b+)?(c))*/.exec("zaacbbbcac")
(z)((aa)( )  (c))
   (( ) (bbb)(c))
   ((a) ( )  (c))
     ^   ^    ^
     a   bbb  c</pre>  
Here `"bbb"` incorrectly "fall-through": `match[4]` should be `undefined` or at least `""`

### Numbers

- `parseInt` still accepts octal
- `Number.prototype.toString(undefined)` fails with error
- `Number.prototype.toFixed(Infinity)` should fail with `TypeError`
- `(1e21).toFixed()` should return `1e+21`, not `1000000000000000000000`

### Arrays

- No `indexOf` and `lastIndexOf` as well as other functional stuff.
- `Array.isArray` is missing
- `array.slice(n, undefined)` always returns an empty array
- `[].sort(undefined)` fails with error
- `Array.prototype.splice` on objects doesn't remove values
- setting non-integer (but numeric) length for array should fail

### Strings

- `trim` and `lastIndexOf` methods are missing
- `"".match()` returns `null`  instead of  `""`
- `"".search()` returns `null` instead of `0`
- empty strings are not included if `separator` argument is regex: `"101101".split(/1/) === ["0", "0"]`
- capturing groups are not included in the final results: `"010".split(/(1)/) === ["0", "0"]`
- `split` should not coerce  to string `undefined` passed as `separator` argument
- `split` should coerce `limit` argument with `ToUint32`
- incorrect `length` value for `fromCharCode`, `replace`, `slice`, `search`, `indexOf` and `lastIndexOf` methods

### Misc

- ES5 methods of `Object` are not supported. `defineProperty` and `getOwnPropertyDescriptor` are present. Alas, MSDN tells us that function <blockquote>... supports DOM objects but not user-defined objects. The <strong>enumerable</strong> and <strong>configurable</strong> attributes can be specified, but they are not used</blockquote>
- `Date.prototype.toISOString` is missing
- `Object.prototype.toString` incorrectly returns `"[object Object]"` when applied to `window`, DOM nodes, `undefined` or `null`.
- JSON shouldn't allow characters `U+0010` through `U+001F`
