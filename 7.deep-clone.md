### TL;DR

`angular.copy` from AngularJS 1.x is quadratic-slow on large objects, especially in IE. 

Use `JSON.stringify`/`JSON.parse` for simple objects or `_.deepClone` for objects with `Date` objects or cyclic references. Actually, if you don't clone objects of more than 1000 nodes, this shouldn't bother you.

### How I bumped into it

The other day I faced with a need to deeply clone an object from the redux store and since we're using angular I initially thought about [angular.copy](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/function/angular.copy), but then I remembered, that its use is being discouraged because of "being very slow in IE".

Maybe, it was an old bug an now it's fixed? A quick search showed that [there's an issue on github](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/11099) and it's still open.

OK, but how exactly slow is that function? People report it being slow on large objects.
I quickly created a generator of random objects of certain nesting depth and total node count, and a suite to test function. [Here's a gist](https://gist.github.com/kirilloid/14ec1da29355b6dc0523743f600747e9) with everything combined. In order to measure one needs to run `suite` with deep cloning function passed as an argument.

### Other options?

So `angular.copy` turned out to be really slow. Even though it was OK for the case I started with, I went [too far to stop researching the question](https://xkcd.com/242/). What other options do we have? Of course, I can write a stupid recursive cloner in ~10 lines of code and call it a day, but since I'm an ENTERPRISE developer and that day I didn't feel like writing my own solution, I considered existing libraries and really trivial methods, which could be written in a single line.

Actually, somewhere near the end of writing that post, I implemented simple cloner, and ... discovered nothing new. It's faster than much more elaborate `_.deepClone`, but not that much. You can see a green line on the chart for the Chrome below.

So I stuck with the following four methods:

* `angular.copy` — which I started from;
* `lodash.cloneDeep` — a method from the most popular utility library. I think similar methods from other libs would work roughly the same;
* JSON — vanilla js, works surprisingly fast;
* utilizing structured clone via `postMessage` — also vanilla js w/o serialization overhead.

The last option is the most _interesting_ one. The thing is browsers have built-in support for a magic called [structured cloning](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Structured_clone_algorithm) of objects, but it's not directly accessible via JavaScript. It is hidden inside [postMessage API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage), so we just need to send a message to the same window. The only problem I expected was that such a function would be asynchronous. Alas, API call blows up with an error on function properties. And what's worse, it seems to leak memory in IE: the full suite failed with "out of memory" so I had to run it in 3 parts. During tests, I just used `postMessage` w/o getting it back. That was enough to measure cloning process. More or less proper implementation is [available in the same gist](https://gist.github.com/kirilloid/14ec1da29355b6dc0523743f600747e9#file-cloneviapostmessage-js).

### Quality

| method | cycles | non-trivial types | preserves prototypes | functions |
|:--|---|---|---|---|
| [angular.copy](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/function/angular.copy) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| [_.cloneDeep](https://lodash.com/docs/#cloneDeep) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅<a href="#note-1"><sup>1</sup></a> |
| [JSON](https://mdn.io/JSON) | &#x1f6d1; | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| [postMessage](https://mdn.io/structured_clone) | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | &#x1f6d1; |

- _non-trivial types_ is for `Date` and other built-in objects
- _preserves prototypes_ is for user-defined custom objects
- &#x1f6d1; means that function fails with an exception instead of silently changing or throwing data away

### Reference

**Test env**

* CPU: i5-4210M @2.6GHz
* OS: Win10
* libraries: Angular 1.6.7, lodash 4.17.4
* Browsers: Chrome 63, Firefox 56, IE 11, Edge 14

I also checked `angular.copy` in Safari on [@sublimeye](https://twitter.com/sublimeye)'s Mac, but results are uninterestingly similar to Chrome apart from his CPU (i7-4770HQ @2.2GHz) is significantly faster than mine. Edge is almost the same as IE.

### Footnotes

<span id="note-1">1 — documentation for `clone` says that functions are transformed into empty objects and `cloneDeep` works the same. But that's true only if we pass a function directly to the `cloneDeep`. Any nested function property is just copied by a normal `=`.</span>'
